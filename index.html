  <body>One of the major reasons people are diagnosed with lung cancer is smoking. 
  Whether it’s a cigar or an electronic cigarette, it is dangerous! Even if you are currently
  smoking, STOP! Also encourage people you are near daily to stop smoking, because it could affect you too. 
Also just stay healthy in general! Eating fruits and vegetables don’t hurt! The vitamins and nutrients in these
foods definitely help! Also, EXERCISE! Whether it’s a stroll in the park or a hike in the woods, it helps. Staying
fit and healthy definitely reduces cancer risk. </body>
