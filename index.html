Lung cancer is a terrible cancer that is around us. Every one in four cancer deaths are lung cancer, and it has one
  of the lowest survival rates of cancer.There are more lung cancer deaths than colone, breast, and prostate combined. Even though
  you can't completely prevent it, taking these 6 steps could stop you from being the next cancer victim.

<p><h3><b>Don't Smoke:</b> Smoking is the number one reason for lung cancer. Both smoke and tobacco are 
dangerous to you and people around you. By quitting you already reduce your risk, and the longer
you go without smoking, the more your risk decreases. Make sure the danger of smoking is stressed
in your household.</h3></p><br><br>
  
  <p><h3><b>Avoid Secondhand Smoke:</b>Secondhand smoke is when you are near somebody else who is 
  smoking, and could potentially inhale it. If you are around secondhand smoke, you nearly have the same
  risk for lung caner as regular smokers. Try to stay in smoke-free areas, and keep your house and car smoke-free.
  </p></h3><br><br>
  
  <p><h3></p><b>Check For Radon:</b>Radon is a radioactive gas that can be extremely dangerous to humans.
  Not only is it dangerous to you as a person, but to your lung cancer risk. Check if where
  you live has a history of radon. Also, you can buy radon testers at your local department of 
  health or a hardware store.</p></h3><br><br>
 
 <p><h3><b>Eat Fruits And Vegetables:</b>Studies have shown a meaningful drop in lung cancer risk
 when you eat more fruits and vegetables. This happens because of the vitamins and nutrients in these
 foods. Make sure not to overdose your intake of vitamins, as this could increase your risk.</p></h3><br><br>
  
  <p><h3><b>Exercise Regularly:</b> Exercising regularly can lead to a large decrease in your risk.
  Any exercise helps, from a walk in the park to vigorous weight lifting. Staying active is another great
  way to stay fit and decrease you cancer risk.</p></h3><br><br>
  
  <p><h3><b>Eat Foods High in Antioxidants:</b>Foods high in antioxidants decrease your risk similarly to
  eating fruits and vegetables. Food high in antioxidants include blueberries, cranberries, beans, prunes
   and artichokes.<b>90%</b>!</p></h3><br><br>
